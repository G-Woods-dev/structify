# Structify

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
Our challenge was parsing through unstructured data and structuring it through a language of choice.

Examples:
If a small business stores its receipts in a .csv fle, or a contractor handles his logs through a .txt file

## Project Description 🤯
Once you log into our webpage, you receive the ability to upload .txt or .csv files that are parsed through OpenAI API and generated into the database structure of your choice. The current options are from .txt, .csv -> .sql, .sqlite, .db file options. This will store it in a database where you can access these database files whenever you need to.

## Project Value 💰
Our application would target small and medium businesses. Many companies focus on the higher-end result for the data storage centers. This allows a small temporary storage site that uses Artificial Intelligence to create tables, column names based on the type of data, then writes the commands that will import the data into rows.
